# Weather-Data-Clustering-using-k-Means

In this notebook, I will use cluster analysis to generate
the big picture model of the weather at the local station
using a minute granularity data.

In this data set we have in the order of
millions of records. It's a large data set, largish data set for some of us.

## Our goal will be to create 12 clusters from them.

NOTE: The dataset we will use is in a large CSV file called minute_weather.csv.
