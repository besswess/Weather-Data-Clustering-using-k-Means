# Weather-Data-Clustering-using-k-Means

In this notebook, I will show how to perform k-means lustering using scikit-learn in Python.

I will use cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. In this dataset, I have in the order of millions records. How do we create 12 clusters our of them?

NOTE: The dataset we will use is in a large CSV file called minute_weather.csv.
